defmodule Supabase.Storage do
  @moduledoc """
  Supabase.Storage Elixir Package

  This module provides integration with the Supabase Storage API, enabling developers
  to perform a multitude of operations related to buckets and objects with ease.

  ## Usage

  You can start by creating or managing buckets:

      Supabase.Storage.create_bucket(client, "my_new_bucket")

  Once a bucket is set up, objects within the bucket can be managed:

      Supabase.Storage.upload_object(client, "my_bucket", "path/on/server.png", "path/on/local.png")

  ## Examples

  Here are some basic examples:

      # Removing an object
      Supabase.Storage.remove_object(client, "my_bucket", "path/on/server.png")

      # Moving an object
      Supabase.Storage.move_object(client, "my_bucket", "path/on/server1.png", "path/on/server2.png")

  Ensure to refer to method-specific documentation for detailed examples and explanations.

  ## Permissions

  Do remember to check and set the appropriate permissions in Supabase to make sure that the
  operations can be performed without any hitches.

  ## Params

  - `client`: The `Supabase.Client` to use to interact with the Storage service.
  - `id`: A unique identifier for the bucket you are creating.
  - `options.public`: The visibility of the bucket. Public buckets don't require an authorization token to download objects, but still require a valid token for all other operations. By default, buckets are private.
  - `options.file_size_limit`: Specifies the max file size in bytes that can be uploaded to this bucket. The global file size limit takes precedence over this value. The default value is `nil`, which doesn't set a per bucket file size limit.
  - `options.allowed_mime_types`: Specifies the allowed mime types that this bucket can accept during upload. The default value is `nil`, which allows files with all mime types to be uploaded. Each mime type specified can be a wildcard, e.g. image/*, or a specific mime type, e.g. image/png.
